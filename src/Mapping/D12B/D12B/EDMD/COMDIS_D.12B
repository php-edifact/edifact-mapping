0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Commercial dispute
       message (COMDIS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and
       transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A notice of commercial dispute against one or more invoices is
       usually raised by the buyer to notify the seller that something was
       found wrong with the goods delivered or the services rendered (goods
       damaged, delivery incomplete, delivery late, etc.). The dispute must
       be resolved before the related invoice can be settled.
       
       The message will be used to: - notify a dispute; - correspond about
       an existing dispute (structured information); - notify the
       settlement of a dispute.
       
       The message will serve at the same time as the dispute notice and as
       the dispute answer.
       
       Throughout this document, the term 'Buyer' refers to either the
       buyer or an Agent acting on behalf of the Buyer, and the term
       'Seller' refers either to the seller or an Agent acting on behalf of
       the Seller.

1.2    Field of application

       The Commercial dispute message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The usual flow of communication is from buyer to seller: the buyer
       sends a dispute notice to the seller, and the seller sends back a
       dispute answer to the buyer. Optionally, the seller may also send a
       credit note. An alternative flow of communication is from seller to
       buyer, e.g. if the seller disputes the payment of a related invoice.
       
       If part of the invoice is disputed, then as a consequence the whole
       invoice will be disputed.
       
       - One dispute may relate to one or more invoices/credit notes;
       - One dispute may relate to one or more payments;
       - One dispute must relate to one seller;
       - One dispute must relate to one buyer.
