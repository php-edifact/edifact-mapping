0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Container
       discharge/loading order message (COPRAR) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to order to the container terminal that the containers
       specified have to be discharged from a seagoing vessel or have to be
       loaded into a seagoing vessel.
       
       This message is part of a total set of container-related messages.
       These messages serve to facilitate the intermodal handling of
       containers by streamlining the information exchange. 
       The business scenario for the container messages is clarified in a
       separate document, called: 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT
       container messages'.

1.2    Field of application

       The Container discharge/loading order message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Business area:
       Loading and discharging of containers/equipment
       
       Sending functions include:
       Ship's agent, Liner agent
       
       Receiving functions include:
       Container terminal, Stevedore
       
       In the context of the 'Guide to the scenario of EDIFACT container
       messages' (as referred to at the start of section 1) the following
       guidelines, rules and functionality apply to this Container
       discharge/loading order message:
       
       *   The message contents can be uniquely identified by a combination
       of the following data elements:
       - ordering customer, coded (NAD)
       - ordering customer agent, coded (NAD)
       - container discharge/loading order reference (RFF)
       
       The ordering customer agent, coded is needed to supplement the
       unique identification only in the following situation: the agent
       acts on behalf of several ordering customers issuing the same range
       of reference numbers for each customer.
       E.g., the ship's agent acts on behalf of several shipping lines
       issuing for each shipping line the same range of numbers.
       
       *   A message contains information on only one visit/conveyance of a
       seagoing container vessel either arriving or departing.
       
       *   A message contains an order for either discharging or loading
       containers from or into the seagoing container vessel. One order
       message does not necessarily cover all containers to be
       loaded/discharged.
       
       *   An indicator for the equipment status may be completed on
       container level (EQD-segment), e.g., import, export, transhipment,
       shifter.
       
       *   One shipping line can be specified on message level.
       
       *   The sea-going container vessel and sea voyage number can be
       specified on message level.
       
       *   For each container its cell position on board the container
       vessel and its port of discharge can be given.
       
       *   For each container dangerous goods information can be specified.
       
       *   If the container prefix and number is not known (in the loading
       order message), a supplementary container reference number
       (Container sequence number) is used to identify a container group in
       the message to be able to refer to this information of the
       container(s) in the loading report message.
       
       *   In case of a loading order an equipment guideline can be
       specified in the message in order to load (empty) containers that
       cannot be identified by their full prefix and serial numbers.
       In case of a guideline a combination of size and type and/or a
       certain range of equipment serial numbers (container prefix and
       numbers) can be given for a group of one or several containers.
       
       *   Goods item details cannot be completed.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
