0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Booking
       confirmation message (IFTMBC) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       This paper provides the definition of the Booking Confirmation
       Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading
       partners in the  transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of
       cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI).
       
       This message is a single consignment based message, being aligned
       with other single consignment based messages such as the other two
       booking messages (IFTMBP and IFTMBF), the instruction messages
       (IFTMIN and IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).
       The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of
       transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin
       to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial
       practice.
       These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of
       goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment
       (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
       forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the
       information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the
       goods.
       They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when
       the requirements are common even if functionally similar information
       is known by different names.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message from the party providing forwarding and/or transport
       services to the party booking those services giving the confirmation
       information to the booking of the consignment concerned. A
       confirmation might read that the booking of a consignment is
       accepted, pending, conditionally accepted or rejected.
       
       The conditions under which requested services take place may be
       given in this message.
       
       This message can also be used between vessel operators, vessel
       sharing partners and cargo receiving and handling facilities such as
       marine terminals, inland receiving depots, rail ramps and truck
       terminals to confirm cargo particulars and equipment requirements of
       the transport provider to the service provider responsible for
       dispatching empty equipment and receiving the cargo.

1.2    Field of application

       The Booking confirmation message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message can be used whenever a confirmation of the booking of a
       consignment is deemed necessary as an answer to a booking
       provisional or booking firm message concerning a certain
       consignment. It can also be used to confirm cargo particulars and
       equipment requirements.
       
       The use of a Booking Confirmation Message is not compulsory.
       
       - A consignment may contain several goods items.
       
       - Goods items may or may not be containerized.
       
       - A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a
       single container may contain one or more goods items.
       
       - One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.
       
       - Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in
       one or more containers.
       
       - Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational
       description of the goods.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order
       transport for one or more goods items.
       
       - A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue
       instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by
       means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF,
       IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.
       
       - Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination
       haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or
       instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified
       with its own transport details group.
       
       - Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a
       temperature control unit attached to a container.
       
       - Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on
       another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to
       or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a
       container on a chassis on a rail-car.
       
       - Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on
       their own, are specified in the transport details group. Other load
       or transport devices are specified as equipment.
       
       - The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up
       to three levels.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
