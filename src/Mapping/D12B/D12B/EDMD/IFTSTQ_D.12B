0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       multimodal status request message (IFTSTQ) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to request an International multimodal status report
       message (IFTSTA) in order to provide details relating to transport
       status and/or a change in the transport status between agreed
       parties.

1.2    Field of application

       The International multimodal status request message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message allows for the request of information regarding the
       status of the physical movement of consignments, goods, or equipment
       at any point (in time or place) within the full transport chain.
       
       The request for status can be made by either:
       
       a) using the top level segments to request information about one or
       a number of consignments relating to a point or period of time,
       location(s), party related reference(s) and party(s), means of
       transport(s) and equipment(s).
       
       b) using the CNI segment group and making reference to a unique
       consignment reference number per consignment and indicating, if
       necessary, the criteria (date(s), location(s), etc.) for which the
       status is requested.
       
       APPROACHES a) AND b) MUST NOT BE USED TOGETHER WITHIN
       ONE IFTSTQ MESSAGE.
       
       Data requirements for tracking equipment, where equipment is not
       associated with a consignment (such as repair container), are not
       addressed in this message.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations
       for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup
       ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these
       recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.
