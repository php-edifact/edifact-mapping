0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Data Plot Sheet
       (DAPLOS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
       trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The UN Standard DAPLOS may be used for both national and
       international trade. It is based on universal commercial practice
       and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to describe the data plot sheet exchanged between farmers
       and suppliers. This information includes technical description and
       information of the crop production in order to give information
       about traceability to the farmer's partners (cooperatives,
       manufacturers, suppliers etc.)

1.2    Field of application

       The Data Plot Sheet may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practice related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the
       type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message is an exchange between and agricultural unit and a
       receiving organisation (such as cooperatives, manufacturers, food
       industry).
       
       This message is divided in two parts:
       
       The Header section containing
       
       - The document number
       - The identification of the parties involved
       
       The Detail section providing the breakdown of 1 to n plots sheets
       contained in the exchange:
       
       - General points on the plot sheet (dates, species, variety, area,
       contracts, etc.)
       - History of the plot (previous crops, enrichment, etc.)
       - Analysis (details of soil analyses carried out on the plot.)
       - Events (i.e. all events such as observations, advice, actions
       taken, etc.)
       
       This breakdown will be provided as many times as there are plot
       sheets in the document.

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates and/or times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction
       agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative
       format.
       Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the
       required period as indicated in the date or time or period format
       qualifier (weeks,months,etc.). 
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment
       of the group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
