0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Insurance claim
       assessment and reporting message (ICASRP) to be used in Electronic
       Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The Insurance claim assessment and reporting message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       The Insurance claim assessment and reporting message is exchanged
       between all parties involved in the claims handling process. Claims
       handling parties include insurers, intermediaries, assessors and
       repairers. The claims handling process includes the functions, claim
       notification, assessment request, assessment report, repair
       estimate, repair authorisation, claim progress reporting.

1.2    Field of application

       The Insurance claim assessment and reporting message may be used for
       both national and international applications. It is based on
       universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       Each message contains information relating to one insurance claim
       against one policy only, although any related claims may be
       referenced. A claim results from one incident, although that
       incident may have many sub-incidents. For example the claim may
       result from storm damage, but that may include lightning strike,
       flood damage and fire damage caused by electrical short circuit. The
       message supports all types of claims, including motor, household,
       commercial. The specific type of object which is the subject of the
       claim is specified within the risk object details group. A generic
       'component' group is positioned below the risk object and is used to
       describe information relating to the risk object. The actual content
       of the component group will vary depending on the type of risk
       object, for example if the object is a motor vehicle the components
       may include modifications and security devices, but if the object is
       a house the components may include construction and occupancy. The
       type of component is specified by a code within the component
       details segment which identifies a type of entity from the insurance
       data model. The re-usable component group is also used elsewhere in
       the message to provide the flexibility needed to describe the other
       main information blocks, such as incident, party and insurance
       history. Inside each of the segment groups an identity segment is
       positioned to allow the provision of unique identifiers for each
       instance of the group. The identifiers may then appear inside other
       segment groups as 'keys' that provide a relational link e.g. linking
       each object to its appropriate insurance cover, linking parties to
       documents or linking child objects to their parent object. Some of
       the information in the message appears twice, in a 'before' and
       'after' state. The insurer will provide information on cover as
       defined in the policy, together with any conditions and limitations
       for example there may be a minimum and maximum excess amount written
       into the policy. The information is then used by the person
       assessing the claim to derive the covers and amounts that apply to
       the circumstances of the claim e.g. the amount of excess to be paid
       on this claim
