General Introduction

0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Job information
       demand message (JINFDE) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
       (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message sent by a governmental agency to an employer in response
       to a work grant request. This message asks for specific additional
       information (e.g. visa) for further processing of the work grant
       request.

1.2    Field of application

       The Job information demand message may be used for both national and
       international applications. It is based on universal practice
       related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not
       dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The message is designed to request additional information about a
       person and/or a job (e.g. specific documents) for further processing
       of a work grant or permit request.
       
       A Job Information Demand Message is transmitted from a governmental
       agency to an employer.
       
       A Job Information Demand Message may contain detailed information
       about a person and/or the required missing documents.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment table
       which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message
       and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation
       of the message:
       
       All specified dates and times should be in the format 'yymmdd' or
       'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that
       there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods
       should be specified as whole numbers representing the required
       period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
       be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be
       included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments
       does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment
       of a group.

4.1.1  Header section


       Information to be provided in the Header section:

00010   UNH, Message header
        A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message. The
        message type code for the Job information demand message is JINFDE.

        Note: Job information demand messages conforming to this document
        must contain the following data in segment UNH, composite S009:

        Data element  0065 JINFDE
                      0052 D
                      0054 12B
                      0051 UN

00020   BGM, Beginning of message

        A segment specifying general dates and, when relevant, times
        related to the whole message. The segment must be specified at
        least once to identify the document date. The Date/time/period

           each other, thus only the coded identification is required, but
           a job center or a job application address (interview) may vary
           and would have to be clearly specified, preferably in structured
           format.
